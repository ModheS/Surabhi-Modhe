Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a company's customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group.
Grouping people correctly increases the probability of the customer to buy the product, and putting it wrong decreases it. think of customer 
behavior like playing tennis, taking the subway, etc. For example, if we show special ads to those who take the subway, it will work for our 
benefit.
