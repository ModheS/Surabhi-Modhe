This repository contains code and data for performing customer segmentation using three popular clustering algorithms: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. Customer segmentation is a valuable technique that groups customers based on similar characteristics, behaviors, or preferences, which helps businesses gain insights, make data-driven decisions, and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. For example, if we show special ads to those who take the subway, it will work for our 
benefit.

Clustering

K-means: A partition-based clustering algorithm that aims to divide data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

Hierarchical Clustering: An agglomerative clustering algorithm that creates a hierarchical representation of data by iteratively merging similar clusters until a single cluster is formed.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): A density-based clustering algorithm that groups data points based on density and identifies outliers as noise.
