# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
**Dataset**  
The CIFAR-10 dataset is used, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

**Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Image Classification**  
First build a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for image classification. 

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification**  
Next, build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. 

**Model Evaluation**  
Trained both the ANN and CNN models on the training data and evaluate their performance on the test data. The CNN model outperforms the ANN model, achieving a higher accuracy due to its ability to capture spatial features in images.

**Conclusion**  
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful architecture for image classification tasks. It demonstrates better accuracy compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for tasks involving images.
