# Real Estate Price Prediction Project
This repository contains code for predicting home prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. The code is organized into various sections, each performing specific tasks of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The dataset used for this project is the "Bangalore Home Prices" dataset.

**Project Overview**  
This project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the prices of homes in Bangalore based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.

**Repository Contents**
* Data Load: Load the Bangalore home prices dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and perform an initial exploration of the data.
* Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and perform data cleaning operations to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
* Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones, such as calculating the price per square foot and adding the number of bedrooms, hall, and kitchen (BHK) as a new feature.
* Outlier Removal: Remove outliers based on business logic to ensure the data is more representative and reliable.
* Model Building: Build a Linear Regression model to predict home prices based on the available features.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using various techniques like cross-validation and scoring metrics.

**Results**  
The project results in a predictive model that can estimate home prices in Bangalore based on various input features. The Linear Regression model achieved a score of approximately 86.29% accuracy on the test data.

**Acknowledgments**  
The project code and dataset were used for educational purposes and were adapted from a data science project focused on predicting home prices in Bangalore.
