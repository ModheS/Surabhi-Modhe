A website that forecasts home prices is this project. First, I created a model with the banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com using sklearn and linear regression. The next step is to create a Python Flask server that processes http requests using the saved model. The third element is a website made using html, css, and javascript that asks the python flask server for the anticipated price once the user enters information about their home's square footage, bedrooms, etc. Data science topics like feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation, and others are examined during the model construction process. In terms of technology and tools, this project uses Python, Numpy, and Pandas to clean data.
